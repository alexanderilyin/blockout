# Blockout and children's privacy

Blockout is used by 3rd graders, mostly under 13, starting at Cadence Park (Irvine Unified School District, California). That brings in FERPA (student education records), COPPA (children under 13 online) and California's SOPIPA (student data held by K–12 services). This page says what we keep and why.

## Guests keep everything on their device
- Playing as a guest (the default) stores nothing on our server. Progress, stats and settings stay in the browser's local storage.
- A live class game keeps only the first name typed in, in memory, and forgets it when the class ends.

## Signed-in accounts
When a student, teacher or parent signs in, the server (`server/store.js`) keeps:

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| First name and **last initial** only | To show names to the teacher and parents ("Maya K.") |
| Role (student, teacher or parent) | To decide who can see what |
| The **email domain** only, e.g. `iusd.org` | To match a school; the address itself is never stored |
| An opaque ID from the sign-in provider | To recognise the same account next time |
| The game save: points, unlocks, which multiplication facts are mastered, recent games | Progress, class stats and homework |
| Class memberships, homework, parent links, scheduled tournaments | The features themselves |

We don't collect: full names, email addresses, birthdays, photos, location, contacts, device IDs or anything for advertising.

## Who sees a student's data
- **The student.**
- **Teachers of a class the student joined**, through the roster and student pages.
- **Parents the student linked,** by giving them the code on the student's account page, or a code from the teacher.

Nobody else sees it: not other students, other parents or other teachers.

## No third parties
- There's no advertising and no analytics, and no student data is sold or shared.
- Signed-in students' names are not checked with OpenAI.
- The optional OpenAI name check (only when the server has `OPENAI_API_KEY`) only ever sees the first name a *guest* types to join a live class game.
- Sign-in will go through the school's own identity provider: Keycloak, brokering Google sign-in for `@iusd.org`. Only that provider sees email addresses.

## Deleting data
- A student's data is deleted on request from the school or a parent. For now that's a manual database task; a teacher-facing delete button is on the to-do list.
- Guests can clear their data from Stats → Reset stats, or by clearing the browser's site data.

## Security
- Tokens are signed: HMAC in dev sign-in, RS256 from Keycloak.
- The database is a local sqlite file (`data/`, not in git).
- Deployments must use HTTPS.
