# Configuration

The server (`node apps/server/src/index.js`, or `npm start`) is configured with arguments and environment variables.

## Arguments

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `<port>` (a bare number) | `8080` (or `PORT`) | Port to listen on |
| `--public-url <url>` | none (or `PUBLIC_URL`) | The address students use when it isn't this computer's own, for example a tunnel. Class join links and QR codes use it. |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Port, when no port argument is given |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | none | Same as `--public-url` |
| `BLOCKOUT_DB` | `data/blockout.db` (repo root) | The sqlite file for accounts; `:memory:` keeps nothing (tests) |
| `BLOCKOUT_AUTH` | `dev` | Sign-in provider: `dev` or `keycloak` |
| `BLOCKOUT_AUTH_SECRET` | generated, kept in the database | Dev sign-in's token secret |
| `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` | none | With `BLOCKOUT_AUTH=keycloak`: the realm URL, for example `https://id.example.org/realms/blockout` |
| `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` | none | With `BLOCKOUT_AUTH=keycloak`: the public client's ID |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | none | Adds OpenAI's free moderation model to the name check for guests joining live classes. Without it only the built-in word list runs, and no names leave the server. |

## Schools

Schools are rows in the database with an email domain. The first, **Cadence Park** (`iusd.org`), is created automatically.
